# DM-intro-to-hosting
basic hosting options (see branches), as presented to DevMountain bootcamp students

### Options
We'll go over 4 main options for hosting your web sites/apps. Each has their pros and cons. Each has a branch in this repo with instructions. Summary:  

1. Github pages: frontend only, easy setup, could use BaaS (such as firebase, or hosted sql) for data if needed, FREE
2. Firebase: frontend only, fairly easy setup, could use Baas (such as firebase, or hosted sql) for data if needed, free tier
3. Heroku: full stack if needed, automated deploys, involved setup, free tier
4. VPS (DigitalOcean): full stack (or whatever you want), complete control, medium-complexity setup, everything is up to you, no free tier
